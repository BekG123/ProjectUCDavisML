# My project aims to build software that integrates machine leanring for autonomous bikes starting with tests on the UC Davis campus
# SciKit is used to see the autonomous bike calculation of shortest distance between the student and the bike(whereever the student left it)
# This could be useful in applications when a student lost their bike and the bike needs to configure its way back to the student
